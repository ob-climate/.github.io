- 16 Weeks, 3 Credits

Learning Objectives
======
**Knowledge:** 
1. Students will be able to explain how the Earth works as an energy/matter system with emphasis on the inputs of solar and internal Earth energy.
2. Students will compile and integrate information about the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, cryosphere, and lithosphere of the Earth.
3. Students will be able to explain spatial distributions of environments from an energy/matter physical geography perspective.
4. Students will be introduced to maps and basic map reading skills; concepts such as projections, latitude, and longitude, etc. will be covered.
5. Students will be introduced to the importance of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as they pertain to Physical Geography
   
**Skills:** 1
1. Students will apply skills (through homework, exams, in-class activities) learned in class related to the measurement of Earthâ€™s physical systems, for example map reading, soil analysis via photographs, data collection and analysis of atmospheric or hydrologic process and conditions.
2. Students will analyze patterns and processes of the landscape by utilizing (including but not limited to): various websites, topographic maps, remotely sensed imagery, Google Earth, and photographs.
