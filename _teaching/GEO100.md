LEP Tier 2 - Time and Place (Southern Connecticut State University)
======
This course fulfills the Tier 2, Time and Place category of our general education requirements, The Liberal Education Program. The purpose of the Time and Place category is to appreciate the rich variation in human perspectives on human experience and on nature. Exposure to such perspectives fosters a more cosmopolitan view of the world and provides important context for the students’ understanding of themselves and their own place and time. 
The main objectives of this category are:
Focus – Examining a specific time and/or place with an emphasis on continuity and change. 
Perspective – Encountering unique viewpoints associated with that time or place.
Significance – Understanding the relevance of such perspectives to students’ lives today.
In addition to covering these objectives, this course will also reemphasize at least three Tier 1 Competencies, Critical Thinking, Written Communication, and Creative Thinking.
